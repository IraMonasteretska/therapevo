                                When I work with married guys who want to break their porn habit they generally fall
                                into one of two categories. Either their wife already knows or else she has no idea at
                                all. I don’t think I’ve ever worked with a husband whose wife knows but doesn’t care if
                                he stops or not. In any case, if you’re in that latter category and you know you need to
                                disclose this problem to your wife then today’s episode is for you.
                                Let me just say right off the bat that over the last 10 years the number of women using
                                porn has drastically increased. So we could have just as easily titled this “How and
                                When to Tell Your Husband About Your Porn Addiction” but it is still the case that the
                                majority of users are male. And probably an even greater majority of undisclosed users
                                are male. So please pardon on the male references. Much of what we have to say today
                                would apply just as well to a wife disclosing to her husband for the first time.
                            </p>

                                The short answer is: yes!

                                In our broader culture over the past decades porn was viewed as something normal and
                                harmless. I think some folks still holds this view but in recent years the research has
                                consistently shown that porn use has a wide range of adverse effects on marriage, on the
                                people using the porn, and the people who are in the porn industry. Not all - but many
                                of the actors and actresses are victims of <a href="#">human trafficking</a> and have
                                other very
                                challenging issues they are facing on a daily basis.

                                just to recap and summarize, porn use results in:

                                On top of that, the consequences of keeping the addiction a secret can be just as
                                damaging as the addiction itself. Keeping parts of your life hidden from your spouse,
                                the shame that surrounds the secret, and the fear of being discovered, all erode at the
                                trust and intimacy between a couple. A research study from 2009<a href="#1"
                                    id="t1">[1]</a>
                                found that this
                                secrecy creates a “crack” in the marriage bond, which is then likely to widen as the
                                husband’s shame and fear cause him to emotionally withdraw. So leaving the issue a
                                secret can have harmful consequences.

                                Finally, telling your spouse is an essential first step in change. Keeping it a secret
                                promotes the cycle of shame<a href="#2" id="t2">[2]</a>, where shame and negative
                                feelings
                                compel you to want to
                                use porn to feel better, which creates further shame. This cycle gets harder and harder
                                to break out of unless you tell someone about it and admit to needing help.

                                most. I do think you need to bring one or two same-sex friends into your confidence and

                                But at the same time, it is your wife who has been betrayed by your actions. She has the
                                right to know that the most important person in her life has betrayed her. We had this
                                discussion recently among our counseling team. Is there ever a situation where it makes
                                sense not to disclose? One possible situation is if either of you is on your death bed.
                                Not only is there the shattering impact of loss right in front of you, but also the loss
                                of who your spouse thought you were. That creates some profoundly complex grief to sort
                                through and may just not be fair in a situation like that or if you are in the middle of
                                some other major crisis. Timing may be an issue.

                                But the fundamental components of having a happy marriage are things like commitment,
                                loyalty, and trust. You cannot keep a <a href="#">pornography addiction secret</a> and
                                hope to
                                simultaneously excel at those three things. Not only that but keeping the pornography
                                use secret — even if she never asks about it — is an act of dishonesty. It is my belief
                                that dishonesty is morally wrong. In our Christian faith, we call that sin as it is also
                                an offense against God.
                            </p>

                                I don’t mention this to guilt anyone but to uphold the fact that the truth always sets a
                                person free. Yes, in this case, the truth is going to hurt (badly!) and things are going
                                to get worse before they get better. But if you cannot live in full transparency and
                                honesty with your spouse then your intimacy development will always be arrested by this
                                reality.

                                At the same time: I get it. You probably feel sick about disclosing this problem. It’s
                                likely a huge shame trigger. But the right thing to do is not always the easy thing to
                                do. At the same time, this is a decision only you can make. I am giving you the various
                                parts to consider and I have a bias towards disclosure. But I would not make the
                                decision for you because I cannot accept any responsibility for the outcome of your
                                decision. The consequences are yours alone to bear so the decision is yours alone as

                            <h3>How Do I Tell Her?</h3>
                            <h4>Be Sensitive</h4>
                            <p>
                                It’s important to be aware of the impact this disclosure can have. Revealing that you
                                have been unfaithful to your wife through porn use can lead to feelings of betrayal and
                                trauma, similar to that found after discovering an affair<a href="#3" id="t3">[3]</a>.
                                So be
                                aware of this and
                                expect her to be very shaken by the disclosure. Allow her to express anger if she needs
                                to: do not be surprised by the severity of her emotional response. You need to let her
                                have her pain, you need to acknowledge her pain and I also think it is healthy for your
                                own recovery to witness her pain.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Tell Her All At Once</h4>
                            <p>
                                Guys often think they can soften the blow by spreading out the disclosure. It actually
                                has the opposite effect. A staggered disclosure (telling her small pieces over time)
                                leads to greater trauma. Think about it this way: if you had one major car accident
                                you’d be a little hesitant about climbing back in the vehicle after you recovered but
                                you’d know you need to get on with life. However, if you were rear-ended once every 5-15
                                days for 8 times — you’d probably be much more likely to swear off driving and just take
                                a bus. Each time you were hit again it would exacerbate the previous physical injuries
                                and also increase your level of jumpiness and fear around driving. That’s trauma — a
                                staggered disclosure is a great way to amplify trauma. So you do need to disclose fully
                                in one sitting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your wife will only be able to start trusting you fully once the entire secret is out in
                                the open<a href="#4" id="t4">[4]</a>. See “what to tell her” below as part of
                                considering this.
                                Disclosing little
                                bits over time makes it harder for her to trust you as it will always feel like there
                                could be more she still doesn’t know about.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Accept Full Responsibility</h4>
                            <p>
                                Do not try to justify your actions, or minimize how significant the betrayal is to her.
                                Definitely do not blame it on her for not having sex with you enough<a href="#"
                                    id="t5">[5]</a>.
                                These excuses
                                and justifications will make the disclosure even harder for your wife and can get in the
                                way of her forgiving you and moving on. Also, you can only recover once you have taken
                                full responsibility for your actions yourself.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Have a Plan For Both of You</h4>
                            <p>
                                Research from 2005<a href="#6" id="t6">[6]</a> found that the disclosure often works
                                best if the
                                husband comes to
                                the wife with a plan of action right away. For example, he may admit the problem and
                                suggest therapy right away, or block access to the porn sites he uses. Asking your wife
                                what actions she would like to take is also a good idea. Seeing the addiction as a joint
                                problem both husband and wife are managing (but which husband is ultimately responsible
                                for) helps aid the recovery process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’ll say a little more about having a plan after dealing with the next question, when do
                                I tell her?
                            </p>
                            <h3>When Do I Tell Her?</h3>
                            <p>
                                There is no good time to disclose but there are a lot of bad times. Often guys will
                                disclose in strange situations: at their in-laws for Christmas, or right before a major
                                church function, or just before taking the kids out to a birthday party. I’m not sure
                                why this happens but I have noticed that the motivation for timing is often selfish: the
                                husband just needs to get it off his chest. Maybe he feels like more of a fake just
                                before church so he tells her then.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you know this is going to be a blow, arrange for a babysitter perhaps but start early
                                in the evening or even at the beginning of a weekend. This is me coming back to having a
                                plan. If your wife had no idea this was happening she is totally going to cave. Her
                                world is going to shatter: so disclosing one hour before a family dinner is not the
                                right time. She’ll need you around to ask questions. She’ll need time and space to be
                                alone and to process so try and pick a time where you can clear the calendar a bit. And
                                she’ll also need to be able to reach out to her friends even though that may be really
                                difficult for her to do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It may also be wise to have a counselor or one of your mentors or possibly a friend on
                                standby. Even if you just tell them: “Hey, I have to have a difficult conversation with
                                my wife tonight. I’m not sure if she’ll want to talk but would you be available if she
                                did?”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only caveat here is to be careful about bringing a friend of hers into the secret
                                and having her friend hold that secret too: that could feel like a double betrayal. So
                                you want to keep the timing really tight if you choose this option.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another good option to consider is having some resources on hand. For example, our
                                article on “What to do when you’ve just discovered your husband’s porn habit” and even
                                some books like Debra Laaser’s “Shattered Vows”
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Disclosing the addiction will likely be akin to discovering an affair: it can produce a
                                trauma response and may take weeks/months to fully process. So pick a time when she is
                                ready to hear it and will have some immediate time to react.

                                At the same time, the longer you leave it the worse it can get: both in terms of how
                                hard it will be to break the shame cycle and in how much of a betrayal it will represent
                                to your wife<a href="#7" id="t7">[7]</a>. So with sensitivity in mind, sooner is still
                                better
                                than later.

                            <h3>What Do I Tell Her?</h3>
                            <p>
                                In order for your wife to feel safe in the relationship again and start trusting you,
                                you need to be totally honest with her about the nature and extent of the addiction.
                                Only when all of the secrets are out can trust start to be re-formed between you<a
                                    href="#8" id="t8">[8]</a>. So
                                generally it’s best to follow your wife’s lead on this and give her as much
                                detail/context as she wants to know.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Men often struggle with this due to the shame they feel around their porn addiction, and
                                because they fear it will upset their wives further to hear about it<a href="#9"
                                    id="t9">[9]</a>. However,
                                failure to be honest and open was found by to be the main obstacle to healing the
                                relationship<a href="#10" id="t10">[10]</a>, so is an important goal for husbands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, revealing explicit details and showing her the porn you use is VERY LIKELY to
                                be unhelpful. These details can create unpleasant mental images for your wife, which can
                                lead to traumatic flashbacks and increased distress<a href="#11" id="t11">[11]</a>
                                (Hall, 2015).

                            <h3>Show Your Commitment to Change</h3>
                            <p>
                                A study done in 2005<a href="#12" id="t12">[12]</a> interviewed couples who had
                                recovered from
                                the <a href="#">husband’s porn
                                    addiction</a> and found that one common factor was the husband making overt efforts
                                to
                                change. Husbands who made verbal commitments to breaking their porn habit and backed
                                this up with actions received more support from their wives and made greater progress.
                                Examples of actions include voluntarily signing up to therapy rather than being forced,
                                or taking measures to make it harder for themselves to use porn in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The point is: if you are being honest with your disclosure, you also need to carry
                                through and be honest and open about it being a real problem that requires real
                                solutions.
                            </p>
