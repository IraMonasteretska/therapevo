                                Do you ever fight about who does what in marriage? Or, how decisions are made? Who has
                                the most say,
                                or power, or who can make the final call on some decisions?

                                Most of the time these disagreements come down to the model of marriage we hold to: and
                                when that’s different than the model our spouse holds, conflict is inevitable.

                                Power structure is a topic that is fundamental to marriage. Rarely though, do we
                                actually sit down to discuss our model of marriage when we’re dating or engaged or newly
                                married. So, let’s look at the three models of marriage, how they impact marital
                                satisfaction and then what we do and recommend.
                            </p>

                                Christian authors have come to various interpretations on the Bible’s teachings about
                                how men and women should relate with one another in marriage. Many of these
                                interpretations center around the issue of gender roles and what the Bible means when it
                                speaks of headship and submission. At the end of the day, it really comes down to power.

                                Various models have been created to explain how husbands and wives should function
                                together in the areas of decision making, work, and leadership (which, when we’re
                                distressed as a couple is usually not about leadership but about the much less noble but
                                more pragmatic issue: power).<br>
                                Here’s a rundown of three models of marriage.

                                What we see happening in these marriages is that the wife gains power and influence in
                                other ways: withholding sex, using Scriptures to manipulate, guilting her husband, etc.
                                However, there are authoritarian marriages where both spouses buy into the model and
                                both are very happy. It is easy to get judgmental of this kind of marriage, but if it’s
                                working for two people and she has chosen this model as much as he has, who are we to
                                take it away from them or say it’s wrong?

                                An interesting study was completed using data from the 1996 Religious Identity and
                                Influence Survey to “examine the relationship between religious identity, gender
                                ideology, and marital decision making.” The results of this study showed that:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Conservative Protestants profess a traditional gender-role ideology that the husband
                                    is the head of the family and the leader in making decisions, BUT the actual
                                    decision-making strategies they practice are similar to other religious groups who
                                    profess more liberal ideologies.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Theologically liberal Protestants profess a more egalitarian ideology in terms of
                                    decision making BUT the actual decision-making strategies they practice are not
                                    significantly more egalitarian than conservative Protestants.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When it comes to male headship (the idea that husbands are primarily responsible for
                                    the marriage and family), the number one priority for most conservative protestant
                                    families in terms of actual practice was found to be the husband taking spiritual
                                    leadership of the family. This was cited more often as important in male headship
                                    than breadwinning status or decision-making authority. <a href="#"

                            <p>
                                Firstly, it suggests that in many families, ideology and practice often do not line up.
                                Secondly, when it comes to the actual practice of decision making, submission, and male
                                headship, many religious families – both conservative and liberal protestants alike –
                                seem to meet somewhere in the middle of terms of what practically works for them.<br>
                                I think the point here is, when you discuss this with your spouse, be honest with
                                yourself about what you do practically versus what you claim to believe.

                                The million-dollar question here is “Which structure causes the most power struggles?”
                                or, “Which of the three structures leads to the greatest level of marital satisfaction?”

                                To answer it, let’s look at a 2010 study that examined the relationship between gender
                                ideology, work-to-family conflict, and marital satisfaction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With regards to gender ideology, they had folks rank how much they agreed or disagreed
                                with statements like:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    When the wife works outside the home, the husband should share in <a

                                For work-to-family conflict, participants answered questions related to how their <a

                                    affected family life</a> in areas of free time, the ability to complete chores, and
                                how much
                                they got done around the house. They also rated how much their job kept them from
                                spending time with their spouse and whether or not they felt that the relationship
                                suffered because of work.

                                The researchers found that:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Men’s marital satisfaction was highly affected by whether or not their gender
                                    ideology
                                    matched their spouse’s gender ideology.

                                <li>
                                    Similarly, egalitarian men had above-average levels of marital satisfaction when
                                    they
                                    were married to egalitarian women. <a href="#" class="scrollto">[5]</a>

                                Other studies also affirm this finding: you have to look at both spouse’s gender
                                ideologies – not just one spouse’s. If they match, the couple is above average on
                                marital satisfaction regardless of the model of marriage they adhere to.
                            </p>

                                However, the results of the study were different for women than for men – and much more
                                complicated! For women:

                                    Gender ideology didn’t predict marital satisfaction on its own. It only predicted
                                    marital satisfaction for women in terms of how it interacted with women’s
                                    work-to-family
                                    conflict.

                                <li>
                                    Egalitarian wives would typically ask their husbands to do more housework, which
                                    often
                                    resulted in conflict.

                                    Traditional wives are more accepting of discrepancies in contributions to housework
                                    so
                                    may do more than their fair share and consequently have less conflict which is
                                    better
                                    for the marriage, but harder on the wife.

                                    It comes back to the husbands because at the end of the day it comes down to the

                                    behaviours of their husbands more than their ideologies. <a href="#"

                                It’s more about what you do for each other than what you believe. As a husband, you may
                                hold to an egalitarian view of marriage but if you are sincerely committed to that then
                                you have an equal obligation to all aspects of housekeeping and <a
                                    href="#">child-rearing</a> in terms
                                of actual physical contribution. If your wife hits a patch of work where she is doing a
                                lot of overtime, you’re going to have a full-time job AND most of the housework.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes this is hard to do when you see your buddy at church whose wife takes care of
                                the housework during the day and they do all sorts of fun stuff together in the evening.
                                However, you can’t have egalitarian values and expect traditional outcomes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you’re in a traditional marriage, here’s something to think about: If you’re both
                                earning an income and your wife is doing the bulk of the housework and childrearing,
                                even if there’s less conflict, you are severely taxing one very key member of your
                                household. If the income is necessary, and your <a href="#">wife is willing</a>, you as
                                the husband need
                                to get in there and get things looking a little more egalitarian in terms of workload.
                                It doesn’t require you to abandon your values; it just means you’re giving this huge
                                gift to your wife in helping her when she’s not expecting it.

                                Going back to our question of “which model of marriage has the highest marital
                                satisfaction?” – the answer is a matched model, where you both hold the same view and
                                you both behave accordingly.

                                see husbands taking more responsibility in that area. So yes, different roles, but the

                                that relationships and emotions are a female responsibility is more culturally informed
                                than

                                is such a small, narrow-minded, microcosmic view. A wife is so much more than a maid,

                                there is no reason why a husband can’t do dishes or vacuum either. We both need to be

                                ideas
                                about why we don’t like the other two models as much.

                            <h4>Traditional Model</h4>
                            <p>
                                The traditional model really fails to accommodate the truth of Christ sacrificing
                                himself in love for the church. In Ephesians 5, that is the model of marriage Christians
                                are called to. We don’t see a lot of sacrificing from husbands in traditional marriages.
                                What we do see is a lot of wives doing what they are supposed to do, plus a good portion
                                of what we think HE is supposed to do as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We think it is a set up for the suppression of wives. We’re not saying this happens –
                                there are women in these marriages that flourish – we’re just saying it is easier to get
                                there from a traditional marriage. Also, it’s a much smaller step towards an abusive
                                marriage than the other models because it can easily be used to elevate men over women.
                                Again, most traditional marriages are not abusive – it’s just a shorter step from
                                traditional to abusive.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Egalitarian Model</h4>
                            <p>
                                Our main objection to the egalitarian model is that it fails to acknowledge gender
                                differences. Some differences are socialized, however, we do believe there are intrinsic
                                differences in the genders. For example, women crave love and men crave respect.
                                However, we both need the other as well – there’s just a difference in how we prioritize
                                it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the cooperative aspect is attractive, we think something is lost when we don’t
                                acknowledge the Biblical concept of headship. Not as an authority paradigm, but as a
                                responsibility paradigm. To us, egalitarian seems to be more spineless and fosters the
                                rearing of children that have less concept of authority and the need for respect. Males
                                and females are not equivalent. We are equal, but not equivalent. If we try to erase
                                this, it just confuses the operation of marriage.
